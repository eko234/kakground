# KAKGROUND

why would I do it outside of kakoune?
kakground allows you to select a directory and
dynamically change backgrounds asyncronously
just navigate the buffer and the line you where
you stand will be set as the new background

## Command
  - `kakground` takes one param, the directory with the backgrounds from whichi you will choose and it prints them in a new buffer with the hooks needed to easily change backgrounds
